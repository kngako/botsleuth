        <p class="flow-text">As in many countries, social media has been weaponised, with legions of bots and their human sock puppet masters pushing political agendas and trolling anyone who holds contrary views or opinions.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">BotSleuth draws on a data base of known bots and sock puppets to identify whether an account is credible or not</p>

        <p class="flow-text">As fast as Twitter kills off bots, new ones pop up. If an @name is not in the database the tool looks at the account’s behavior and scores the probability of it being real or not</p>

        <h4>How it works: </h4>
        <ul class="flow-text">
            <li>User sends tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/botsleuth" target="_blank">@botsleuth</a> querying a suspicious @name</li>
            <li>Automated response tells you whether it’s a bot (based on a regularly update database of confirmed bots;</li>
            <li>Tweet includes a link to mobile responsive website that has a search for bots and sock puppets</li>
            <li>For accounts not in our database, we will incorporate Botometer’s open APIs to examine the behavior of accounts. This tool scores their probability of being a bot - or not </li>
            <li>Site also hosts links to free fact-checking tools, videos and verification training resources.</li>
            <li>A blog about fact-checking and new developments in the war against mis-and disinformation</li>
        </ul>
